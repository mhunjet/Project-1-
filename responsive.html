                    <strong>1990</strong>
                    " - He also won the Macau Grand Prix. At the end of 1990, along with his Formula 3 rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl
                    Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sports-Prototype Championship. This was unusual
                    for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries would compete in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One.
                    However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long
                    distance races would help his career."

                <li>

                    during that season, finishing 5th in a car shared with Karl Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In te same year he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second."

                    <strong>1991-1995</strong>
                    " - Following his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes
                    management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by
                    Benetton-Ford for the following race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the UK courts to prevent Schumacher driving
                    for Benetton, but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1996-2006</strong>
                    " - In 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors'
                    Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over 2 years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them
                    expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal. A year later
                    Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (Technical Director) joined Ferrari.
                    
                    Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in
                    the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel
                    efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as "truck",
                    "pig", and "accident waiting to happen". Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a
                    running joke. At the end of 1995, though the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered
                    inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams. Schumacher declared the Ferrari 412T good enough to
                    win the Championship.
                    
                    Schumacher, Ross Brawn, Rory Byrne, and Jean Todt (hired in 1993), have been credited as turning this once struggling
                    team into the most successful team in Formula One history. Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believes the
                    transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat. Eddie Irvine also joined the team, moving from
                    Jordan. During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds
                    faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been."

                    <strong>2005-2006</strong>
                    " - Rule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race, tipping the overall advantage to teams using
                    Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres. The rule changes were partly in an effort to
                    dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting. The most notable moment of the early season for
                    Schumacher was his battle with Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind
                    the Spanish driver. Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher said "I don't think I can count myself in this
                    battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon.... If your weapons are weak you don't have a
                    chance." Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres
                    were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but
                    the six drivers using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap. Schumacher retired in six
                    of the 19 races. He finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion
                    Alonso.
                    
                    2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was
                    already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races. His pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking
                    Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.
                    
                    Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid. This was
                    due to his stopping his car and blocking part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to
                    work his way up to 5th place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of
                    the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage
                    to 11. After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an engine failure) and China, in which Alonso had tyre
                    problems, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season. Although he and Alonso
                    had the same point total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.
                    
                    
                    Schumacher overtakes Kimi Räikkönen for 4th with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos,
                    having dropped to 19th early on
                    The Japanese Grand Prix was led by Schumacher with only 16 laps to go, when, for the first time since the 2000 French
                    Grand Prix, Schumacher's car suffered an engine failure. Alonso won the race, giving himself a ten-point championship
                    lead. With only one race left in the season, Schumacher could only win the championship if he won the season finale and
                    Alonso scored no points.
                    
                    Before the Brazilian Grand Prix, Schumacher conceded the title to Alonso. In pre-race ceremonies, football legend
                    Pelé presented a trophy to Schumacher for his years of dedication to Formula One. During the race's qualifying
                    session, Schumacher had one of the quickest times during the first session and was fastest in the second session; but a
                    fuel pressure problem prevented him from completing a single lap during the third session, forcing him to start the race
                    in tenth position. Early in the race Schumacher moved up to sixth place. However, in overtaking Alonso's teammate,
                    Giancarlo Fisichella, Schumacher experienced a tyre puncture caused by the front wing of Fisichella's car.
                    Schumacher pitted and consequently fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa.
                    Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and Räikkönen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified
                    in the press as "heroic",[102] an "utterly breath-taking drive", and a "performance that ... sums up his career"."

                    <strong>2007-2009</strong>
                    " - While Schumacher was on the podium after winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari issued a press release stating
                    that he would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season. Schumacher confirmed his retirement. The press
                    release stated that Schumacher would continue working for Ferrari. It was revealed on 29 October 2006 that Ferrari
                    wanted Schumacher to act as assistant to the newly appointed CEO Jean Todt. This would involve selecting the team's
                    future drivers. After Schumacher's announcement, leading Formula One figures such as Niki Lauda and David Coulthard
                    hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of Formula One. The tifosi and the Italian
                    press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after
                    he announced his retirement."

                <li>
                    <strong>2010-2012</strong>
                    " - In December 2009 it was announced that Schumacher would be returning to Formula One in the 2010 season alongside fellow
                    German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team. The new Mercedes team was their first majority involvement
                    in an F1 team since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa for Ferrari had initiated
                    a renewed interest in F1, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and
                    to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.
                    After a period of intensive training medical tests, it was confirmed that the neck injury that had prevented him driving
                    for Ferrari the year before had fully healed. Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth £20m.
                    
                    Schumacher's surprise return to F1 was compared to Niki Lauda's in 1982 at age 33 and Nigel Mansell's return in 1994 at
                    age 41. Schumacher turned 41 in January 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with the record set by the
                    oldest F1 champion Juan Manuel Fangio who was 46 when he won his fifth championship."

                    <strong>2013</strong>
                    " - On 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent
                    de Burgin above Méribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste
                    Mauduit, he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet.
                    According to his physicians, he would most likely have died if he had not been wearing a helmet."
